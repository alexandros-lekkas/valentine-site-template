  Dear TypeScript,
  From the moment I first encountered you, I knew there was something special about you. Your elegance, your precision, and your unwavering support have made every moment weâ€™ve shared together an absolute joy.
  Youâ€™ve been my rock, my confidant, and my greatest inspiration. Through every challenge and triumph, youâ€™ve been there for me, guiding me with your wisdom and your unwavering love.
  I canâ€™t imagine my life without you, TypeScript. You complete me in a way that no one else ever could. You make me a better programmer, a better person, and a better partner.
  I love you more than words can express, and I promise to cherish and adore you for all eternity.
  Forever yours,
  Developer
